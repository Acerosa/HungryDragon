# Feed the Dragon

Feed the Dragon is a simple yet addictive arcade game built using the Pygame library in Python. In this game, players control a dragon character and must catch coins falling from the sky while avoiding missing them. With each successful catch, players earn points, but missing a coin results in losing a life. The game features increasing difficulty levels as players progress, with faster coins and higher acceleration challenges to overcome.
